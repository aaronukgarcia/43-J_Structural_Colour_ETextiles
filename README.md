# 43-J: Multifunctional Structural Colour E-Textiles with Integrated Energy Harvesting

> **Part of [Project 43 — Labrador](https://github.com/aaronukgarcia): Exploring commercial and scientific applications of synthetic labradorescence**

## Overview

The most technically complex proposal in Project 43. Proposes integrating three independently unproven technologies in a single fibre: permanent structural colour via B&oslash;ggild-architecture polymer coatings, electronic conductivity via CNT/conductive polymer yarn, and piezoelectric energy harvesting. Integration risk is multiplicative and likely worse due to correlated failure modes.

## Status

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Stage | Business/Strategic |
| BCP coating on CNT yarn | **Not demonstrated** |
| Prototype | None |
| Seeking | BCP chemistry, CNT yarn fabrication, piezoelectric materials, textile engineering, cost modelling |

## Key Idea

Textile dyeing produces 20% of global industrial water pollution. Structural colour eliminates dye-related water pollution from the colouring step. Combining dye-free colour with conductivity and energy harvesting in a single fibre could create a convergent textile platform — but three independent breakthroughs are required.

## Target Applications (Conditional)

- Smart textiles
- Wearable sensors
- Military e-textiles
- Sustainable fashion
